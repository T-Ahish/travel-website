BEM - Block Element Modifier

It is a kinda CSS rule for structuring and making more sense about the CSS for other developers

----Block -> a set of single purpose block which can be used multiple times around the website

----Element -> gives meaning to the block and cannot be used outsite usually has the __(two underscore based on purpose)

----Modifier -> it gives modification to the normal block, example will be a main button which has general layout and button--orange will be orange color button

another example will be an on-hover or on-click property
